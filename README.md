**Blogger FastAPI Backend**

This Blogger project is a modern, scalable, and high-performance backend API built with **FastAPI**, designed to power a full-featured blogging platform. Leveraging the speed and asynchronous capabilities of FastAPI, this backend ensures lightning-fast API responses and clean code architecture. It supports essential blogging features like post creation, editing, deletion, and listing, along with user authentication, comment handling, and category/tag management.

The backend uses **PostgreSQL** as the database and integrates with **SQLAlchemy ORM** for smooth, object-oriented data interaction. All API endpoints are well-documented using FastAPI’s built-in Swagger UI. The project structure follows a modular approach with separate folders for models, schemas, routes, database connections, and utility logic — ensuring maintainability and scalability as the platform grows.

This backend is perfect for developers looking to build their own blogging application, CMS, or personal portfolio with blogging capabilities. It can be easily connected to a React or Next.js frontend to create a seamless full-stack experience.

In short, the Blogger FastAPI project is fast, flexible, production-ready, and well-suited for real-world blogging needs — whether you're learning backend development, contributing to open source, or building your own startup.
